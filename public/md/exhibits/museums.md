# A journey through time - the history of museums

> *Museums are more than containers of things; rather, they are complex reflections of the cultures that produced them, including their politics, social structures, and systems of thought - Dr. Elizabeth Rodini*

Museums allow us to delve into the past and learn from the various cultural and technological developments of our ancestors. When we walk through the exhibits, we can admire pinnacles of human achievement and objects of ordinary use alike. As valuable as these artifacts are, we must not forget about the power of display, granted by museums and galleries. As Dr. Elizabeth Rodini put it, museums are more than containers of things; rather, they are complex reflections of the cultures that produced them, including their politics, social structures, and systems of thought. Today, we are going back in time to see how the museum as a concept evolved.

> The word “museum” comes from the nine Muses, the classical Greek goddesses of inspiration.

Earliest collections of objects and sites of display could be traced back to ancient Rome  (where statuary and war booty were exhibited), medieval church treasuries (for sacred and valuable objects), and traditional Japanese shrines where small votive paintings were hung to draw good favor.

## Wunderkammern

The assemblages of wonders and curiosities in sixteen and seventeen centuries were the closest to museums that we recognize from today. As European travelers and merchants started to extend their territories and discover “new” lands, they brought impressive collections of mineral, vegetal, and artistic treasures. They kept them in their private residences, which allowed them to handle and inspect the curiosities from the comfort of their own home. For that reason, the knowledge derived from sea voyages and colonial conquest was reserved for wealthy elites and their distinguished guests.

> Much like our museums—and differently from church treasuries and displays of war booty—Wunderkammern were intended to deepen people’s knowledge through the presentation of things.

Wunderkammern included all kinds of objects - both natural and artificial. The rarest and extraordinary objects were amongst the most valued, but apart from that there was little or no hierarchy. Wunderkammern were seen as “microcosms” of God’s creation: the cosmos, Greek for “universe,” was encapsulated in one, miniaturized reflection of its total splendour.

### Collection of Francesco I de’ Medici of Florence


A vault room resembling a jewelry box, the Studiolo Francesco I de’ Medici is where the Duke used to study and collect his rare and precious things he picked up during his travels all over the world. The collection was stored in about 20 cabinets that were distributed along the four walls of the room; each cabinet was illustrated with a panel that, in some way, represented what could be found inside.

The Duke of Florence probably arranged his collection according to the four Aristotelian elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Objects as varied as armor, mirrors, and enamels were linked as fire-objects (since they were created using heat), pearls and narcotics (typically diluted for use) as water-objects, and so forth.

### Enlightenment

> *Enlightenment thinkers relied on the emerging tools of secular empiricism, or sense-based evidence, and proof through repetition—that is, the guiding concepts that lie at the root of modern science.*

### British Museum

British Museum is the embodiment of the Enlightenment ideas of the XVIIIth century. Constructed in 1750 by Sir. Robert Smirke, it served as a gift to the British nation and the temple of modern knowledge. Its vast galleries allowed visitors to marvel in wonders from the world of art, architecture, botany, biology and science. Although part of the copious collections was later moved to other buildings, the British museum remained a symbol of the colonial ideals of the time.
